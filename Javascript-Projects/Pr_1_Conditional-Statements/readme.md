# 🚦 JavaScript Conditional Statements Practice

Welcome to the **JavaScript Conditional Statements Practice** project! 🎉

This project includes **20 beginner-to-advanced level programs** focusing on **decision-making using `if`, `else if`, and `else`** in JavaScript.

All programs use simple `console.log` outputs — no functions, arrays, or objects — just pure logic to strengthen your understanding of conditionals.

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- Basics of `if`, `else if`, and `else` chains
- Applying logical thinking to real-world problems
- Writing clean and readable JavaScript code
- Simulating user inputs using variables
